// In the previous example we looked at spawning external processes.
// We do this when we need an external process accessable to a running
// Go process. Sometimes we just want to completely repalce the current
// Go process with another (perhaps non-Go) one.
// To do this we'll use Go's implementation of the classic exec function.
package main

  // For our example we'll exec ls. Go requires an absolute path to the binary
  // we want to execute. so we'll use exec.LookPath to find it (probably /bin/ls).
  binary, lookErr := exec.LookPath("ls")
  if lookErr != nil {
    panic(lookErr)
  }
  // Exec requires arguments in slice from(as opposed to one big string).
  // We'll give ls a few common arguments. Note that the first argument
  // should be the program name.
  args := []string{"ls", "-a", "-l", "-h"}

  // Exec also needs a set of environment variables to use.
  // Here we just provide our current environment.
  env := os.Environ()

  // Here's the actual syscall.Exec call.
  // If this call is successful, the execution of our process
  // will end here will be replaced binary the /bin/ls -a -l -h process.
  // If there is an error we'll get a return value.
  execErr := syscall.Exec(binary, args, env)
